I am a first year Applied Mathematics PhD student supervised by Prof. Nicholas J. Higham and co-supervised by Prof. Fran√ßoise Tisseur at the University of Manchester. I completed my undergraduate and masters degree in Mathematics and Phyics at the University of Warwick, where I simulated light bouncing off of man-made Satellites. I am interests include studying and developing efficient numerical linear algebra algorithms, using low precision floating point arithmetic to speed up computation, and high performance computing.
