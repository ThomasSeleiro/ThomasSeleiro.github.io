I am a first year Applied Mathematics PhD student supervised by Prof. Nicholas J. Higham and co-supervised by Prof. Fran√ßoise Tisseur at the University of Manchester. I completed my undergraduate and Masters degree in Mathematics and Phyics at the University of Warwick, where I studied and simulated light bouncing off of man-made Satellites. My research interests include studying and developing efficient linear algebra algorithms, using low precision floating point arithmetic to speed up computation, and high performance computing.
